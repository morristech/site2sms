A simple wrapper for sending messages free from a python program.
If you are signed up for www.site2sms.com  ,you can use your credentials to send a message programmatically.

After entering them automatically message will be sent.

If success it will be displayed,otherwise It will show the delivery failed message.

site2sms_adv uses custom data pickled already and do not ask for creadentials each time.It only prompts for message and sends it instantly.
